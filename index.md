# Core Positioning Differences

## Sanity (Composable Content Cloud)

Best when you want maximum flexibility and speed through engineering leverage.

- **Schema as code**: Content types are defined in code and versioned like software (PRs, CI/CD). Ideal when your site and content model evolve quickly and you want changes to be reviewable, testable, and repeatable.
- **Real-time collaboration**: Strong live editing and collaborative workflows, especially valuable for distributed teams.
- **Content Lake concept**: Centralized content backend designed to power multiple frontends and channels.
- **Modern frontend alignment**: Typically shines with a Next.js / modern frontend team ready to build a tailored authoring experience.

## Contentful (Composable Content Platform / DXP Direction)

Best when you want marketing-friendly scale and governance, often within a more enterprise operating model.

- **Composable platform story**: Structured, reusable content designed for multi-channel delivery.
- **Marketer-facing experience tooling**: Expanding into low-code / experience-building capabilities alongside the core platform.
- **Enterprise controls + ecosystem**: Strong out-of-the-box governance and broad integration marketplace.
- **Platform-led approach**: Fits teams that prefer operating within established conventions rather than deeply customizing the CMS UI.

# Landing Page Velocity (What Marketing Feels Most)

## Where Sanity Tends to Win

- **Fast iteration after setup**: Once a modular “sections” system (hero, testimonials, FAQ, CTA, etc.) is built, marketing can assemble pages quickly.
- **Engineering extensibility**: Developers can add new modules without being constrained by rigid UI patterns.
- **Excellent preview workflows**: Real-time editing paired with frontend preview tooling (common in Next.js/Vercel setups).

**Tradeoff:** Requires upfront investment to design and build the authoring experience marketing wants.

## Where Contentful Tends to Win

- **Earlier marketer autonomy**: Faster time to usable page-building capabilities with less custom CMS development.
- **Governance-aligned velocity**: Easier to roll out structured approval workflows in organizations with compliance, legal, or brand review requirements.
- **Lower initial customization lift**: Less need to deeply configure the editorial UI before marketing can start shipping pages.

# Governance, Approvals, Roles (Brand Safety at Speed)

## Sanity

- Governance is highly configurable but often depends on how Studio is implemented.
- Best when marketing and web teams collaborate closely.
- Works well if you are comfortable treating content structure as product surface area managed via code.

## Contentful

- Often preferred when standardized governance patterns are required across teams and regions.
- Clearer enterprise permission models out of the box.
- Strong fit when you want predictable, platform-defined workflows.

# Personalization / Experimentation Readiness (Growth Loops)

## Sanity

- Strong when personalization lives in the frontend or experimentation platform (Optimizely, LaunchDarkly, homegrown rules).
- Developers can easily model experiment variants, audience rules, and reusable content blocks.
- Well-suited to product-led growth environments.

## Contentful

- Investing heavily in DXP-style capabilities, including AI and personalization directions.
- Frequently integrated into enterprise experimentation stacks.
- Good fit when experimentation is coordinated across multiple teams and sys
