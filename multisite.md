# 🌐 Multi-Site in Contentful

Contentful supports multi-site architectures through:

- **Spaces** (often one per brand)
- **Environments** (dev, staging, production)
- **Shared content models**
- **Role-based permissions**

This structure works well when governance and brand separation are top priorities.

---

## ⚠ Operational Considerations

When using separate Spaces per brand, you may encounter:

- Content duplication across brands  
- Sync overhead between shared content  
- Higher pricing tiers as spaces, seats, and API usage increase  
- More operational complexity managing permissions and deployments  

---

## Where Contentful Shines

For enterprise organizations with:

- Dozens of brands  
- Regional or global content teams  
- Strict compliance and governance requirements  

Contentful’s structured separation model can provide clarity and control at scale.

It may introduce more complexity than necessary.  
Operational overhead and migration cost could outweigh governance benefits.
